Thermostat Sensor Project:
   

This project allowed us to combine python software development with the physical build of a thermostat utilizing a Raspberry Pi Microcontroller. The python software, microcontroller, peripheral components, lcd screen, led lights, wiring, circuit, and breadboard all came together and created a thermostat. We are able to display the current temperature to the lcd screen, see lights blink or be solid accordingly, and interact with the thermostat through buttons. We can increase the set temperature or decrease it. The entire project was very practical and hands on. I really anjoyed physically building the project, but I got really excited when the code made it responsive. I don't think I could pick a most favorite part of the project. I will be continuing to use these components and make new projects in the future utilizing the same peripherals and libraries. I think the ability to code this project will be very transferrable to projects in the future. The Raspberry Pi is a great microcontroller and knowlege of how to use it and build with it will be very valuable. The code was very readable and maintainable as comments throughout made understanding the project very clear. Each method and section of the code was very easy to understand while reviewing the project. The project is also adaptable as it has the capability to become wifi and cloud compatable, especially while utilizing a Raspberry Pi microcontroller.
